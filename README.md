# misc-useful-R-functions
Miscellaneous R functions that I find useful in day-to-day life in R.

- cbPalette: a few options for colourblind-friendly palettes for graphics
- customPlotTheme: ggplot settings I like to use
- factorToChar: convert all factor columns in a data.frame to character
- myStringSplit: split string at a particular pattern and return a specific position before / after that pattern
- scramble: take an array of length n, preserving n and sum(x), but scrambling its values
- textToChar: converts c(An, array, with, plain, text!) into c("An", "array", "with", "plain", "text!")
- yIntoOrderX: put vector y in the same order as vector x
